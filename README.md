# TensorCodes
This repository contains a random collection of codes written in Python (some are work in progress) to study several
observables in models using HOTRG/TNR/Triad algorithms. For index contractions, mostly NCON is used
since it is faster than "einsum" or "tensordot" in my tests. Recently, I came across "contract"
as introduced first in https://doi.org/10.21105/joss.00753. The different algorithms employed 
were introduced in the following papers: 

HOTRG --> https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.1144  

TNR --> https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.0732

Triad --> https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02414
