# tensorCodes
This contains a random collection of codes written in Python (some are work in progress) to study several 
observables in models using HOTRG/TNR/Triad algorithms. For index contractions, mostly NCON is used
since it is faster than "einsum" or "tensordot" in my tests. The different algorithms employed in these code 
were introduced in the following papers: 

HOTRG --> https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.1144  
TNR --> https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.0732
Triad --> https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02414
