# tensorCodes
This contains a collection of codes written in Python (some are work in progress) to study several 
observables in models using HOTRG/TNR/Triad algorithms. For index contarction, mostly NCON is used. 
The different procedures were introduced in following papers: 

HOTRG --> https://arxiv.org/abs/1201.1144
TNR --> https://arxiv.org/abs/1412.0732
Triad --> https://arxiv.org/abs/1912.02414
